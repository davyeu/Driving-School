# Driving-School

This is .NET project that represents a platform to connection between driving teachers and students.
The establishment of the program is the Microsoft three layers Moodle: Presentation layer, Business Layer and Data Layer.
In the Data layer we store a database of driving teachers and students and their personal details.
We can see the details of the teachers and the students and do many manipulations on them like as set a lesson,
by the GUI that show up at the running of the program.
The Business layer has all the logical operations that enable the manipulation of the driving school.
